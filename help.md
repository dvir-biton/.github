# Contributor Assistance Page

Welcome to the Eclipse IDE contributor community!
We're here to help you get started and make your contribution experience as smooth as possible.

## ðŸ›  Need Help with Installation or Your First Contribution?

The **Eclipse Contributor Mentor Team** is ready to assist you. If youâ€™re facing issues with setup or need guidance on your initial contributions, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out!

### How to Reach Us

- <img src="https://github.githubassets.com/assets/1f64f-25af8353fbea.png" alt="Q&A Icon" width="20" /> **Start a discussion** in our **[Q&A discussions](https://github.com/eclipse-ide/contributing/discussions/categories/q-a)**.
This way, your questions and solutions will remain visible for others in the future. Our mentors and experienced contributors will be there to help!
- If you have problems with the documentation or encounter a mistake, just create an [issue](https://github.com/eclipse-ide/contributing/issues).  

## ðŸ’¬ Questions About Contributions?

For questions about contributing, project details, or to chat directly with Eclipse IDE developers, you have a couple of options:

- <img src="https://element.io/images/favicon.png" alt="Element Icon" width="20" /> **Eclipse Foundation Chat** - If you'd like to connect with the community in real-time, join our chat rooms:
  - **[Eclipse IDE General](https://chat.eclipse.org/#/room/#eclipse-ide-general:matrix.eclipse.org)** - For everything related to the Eclipse IDE.
  - **[Eclipse IDE Newcomers](https://chat.eclipse.org/#/room/#eclipse-ide-newcomers:matrix.eclipse.org)** - Especially for new contributors looking for guidance and tips.

The chat provides a real-time experience but is less visible long-term, so we recommend starting with GitHub Discussions for questions that could help other contributors.
